# Sentiment Analysis Using Machine Learning

## Overview

This project demonstrates sentiment analysis on textual data using machine learning techniques. Sentiment analysis, or opinion mining, involves determining the sentiment expressed in a piece of text, which is valuable for understanding customer opinions, feedback, and market trends.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis is not specified in the repository. Typically, sentiment analysis projects utilize datasets containing text samples labeled with their corresponding sentiments (e.g., positive, negative, neutral). Common datasets include movie reviews, product reviews, or social media posts.

## Analysis Process

The core analysis is conducted in the `Sentiment_Analysis_with_Machine_Learning.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook, encompassing the following steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Load the dataset and explore its structure.
   - Clean the text data by removing noise such as punctuation, stop words, and special characters.
   - Tokenize the text and convert it into numerical representations suitable for machine learning models.

2. **Feature Extraction**
   - Apply techniques like TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) to transform text data into feature vectors.

3. **Model Training**
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
   - Train machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, or Naive Bayes on the training data.

4. **Model Evaluation**
   - Evaluate the performance of the models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score on the testing data.

5. **Prediction**
   - Use the trained model to predict sentiments of new, unseen text data.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Pandas** (Data manipulation)
- **NumPy** (Numerical operations)
- **Scikit-learn** (Machine learning)
- **NLTK** or **spaCy** (Natural Language Processing)
- **Matplotlib** & **Seaborn** (Data visualization)
